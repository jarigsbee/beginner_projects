        <h3>My personal tribute</h3>
        <div class="text">
        <p>freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project are free online platforms for learning web development and programming.  I have been using both for 2 weeks and find the two programs very complimentary.  freeCodeCamp provides a step-by-step guided approach with interactive challenges and projects that are completed directly in the browser.  
        The Odin Project provides projects and challenges that are completed within a real-worl development framework.</p>  
        
        <p>Utilizing both freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project simultaneously has provided a rich learning environment so far.  In the first 2-weeks I have completed 8 challenges and 2 projects with freeCodeCamp.  These interactive step-by-step challenges provided lots of touch-time with HTML and CSS syntax covering structure, forms, lists, images, buttons, color, typograpy, padding, margins, and more.  Simultaneously, I have completed 60% of The Odin Project's Foundations Course.  Through the foundation course I have learned how to use the command terminal, how to set-up git, created a git-hub account, and completed multiple HTML/CSS challenges in VS Code.</p>
        
        <p>The combination of step-by-step challenges in freeCodeCamp focused on learning the language coupled with The Odin Projects focus on executing the language within a real-world developer framework has been great. I would highly recommend that anyone wanting to learn web development and programming check out both freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project.</p>
